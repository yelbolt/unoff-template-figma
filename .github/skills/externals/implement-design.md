# Implement Design

## Overview

This skill provides a structured workflow for translating Figma **spec documents** into production-ready code with pixel-perfect accuracy. A spec document is a Figma page that serves as the single source of truth for a feature's visual design, component usage, behavior, and content — all conveyed through the design itself and its **annotations**.

The workflow ensures consistent integration with the Figma MCP server, proper use of design tokens, correct interpretation of annotations, and 1:1 visual parity with designs.

## Prerequisites

- Figma MCP server must be connected and accessible
- User must provide a Figma URL in the format: `https://figma.com/design/:fileKey/:fileName?node-id=1-2`
  - `:fileKey` is the file key
  - `1-2` is the node ID (the specific component or frame to implement)
- **OR** when using `figma-desktop` MCP: User can select a node directly in the Figma desktop app (no URL required)
- Project should have an established design system or component library (preferred)

## Figma Spec Document

### What Is a Spec Document?

A spec document is a dedicated Figma page (or top-level frame) that describes a feature's UI. It contains:

- **The visual layout** — the actual design composition showing how the UI looks
- **Component instances from the Figma library** — linked to `@unoff/ui` via embedded documentation (descriptions, props, Storybook links)
- **Annotations** — metadata attached to specific layers that provide implementation instructions not visible in the static design

### Important: Node IDs Are Not Stable

Spec documents may be **duplicated across files or branches**. When a document is duplicated, every node receives new IDs. Therefore:

- **NEVER hardcode or cache specific node IDs** from a previous session
- **Always parse the URL provided by the user** to extract the current `fileKey` and `nodeId`
- Treat every URL as a fresh entry point — re-fetch design context and metadata each time

## Annotations

Annotations are the primary mechanism for conveying implementation details that cannot be shown visually. They appear in the `get_design_context` output as `data-*-annotations` HTML attributes on the relevant elements.

### Annotation Categories

There are **three categories** of annotations. Always look for all three when processing design context output.

#### 1. Development Annotations (`data-development-annotations`)

Technical implementation specifications — describe **how** a feature should be built.

**Examples from a real spec document:**

- `data-development-annotations="Spec: Average score given by every readability score"` — explains what a computed value represents
- `data-development-annotations="Spec: Generate a document on figma with the set type scale"` — describes what a button action should do
- `data-development-annotations="Spec: Line height at each stop, (using %), converted to px in the preview"` — explains a calculation detail
- `data-development-annotations="Spec: If enabled, round values (using px only)"` — conditional behavior specification
- `data-development-annotations="Spec: Letter spacing at each stop, (using em), converted to px in the preview (read only)"` — describes a read-only computed field

#### 2. Content Annotations (`data-content-annotations`)

Describe **content that is not visible** in the static design — hidden options, dropdown menus, contextual choices, or references to related specs.

**Examples from a real spec document:**

- `data-content-annotations="Options:\n\n1.  Sync with local variables\n2.  Sync with local styles"` — lists dropdown/menu options that are not shown in the static UI
- `data-content-annotations="Additional details to adjust the type scale"` — describes the purpose of a collapsible section
- `data-content-annotations="Idem: https://www.figma.com/design/..."` — cross-references another node in the same or a different document for identical behavior

**Key behavior:** Content annotations often reveal **hidden UI states** (dropdown menus, dialog content, expandable sections). These options must be implemented even though they are not visible in the screenshot.

#### 3. Interaction Annotations (`data-interaction-annotations`)

Describe **user interaction behavior** — what happens when the user interacts with a component.

**Examples from a real spec document:**

- `data-interaction-annotations="Specs: The stops are indexed to their respective value. If moved, the ratio becomes 'Custom' because the factor is no longer related to the line height preset"` — describes a slider's dynamic behavior and its side effects on other UI elements

### How to Process Annotations

1. **Read every `data-*-annotations` attribute** in the `get_design_context` output
2. **Categorize** each annotation (development, content, or interaction)
3. **Implement the behavior described** — annotations are instructions, not suggestions
4. **Do NOT render annotation text in the UI** — annotations are metadata for the developer, not content for the user
5. **Follow cross-references** — when a content annotation contains a Figma link (`https://www.figma.com/design/...`), fetch that node's design context to get the referenced spec

## External UI Library: `unoff-ui`

The Figma designs in this project use an **external component library** (`@unoff/ui`) that is **connected to a Figma library**. This connection is made through **embedded documentation in component descriptions**, not through Code Connect.

### How the Figma-to-Code Link Works

When `get_design_context` returns a component instance from the Figma library, the output includes **rich documentation** embedded in the component description. This documentation provides:

- **Component name and import path** — the exact `@unoff/ui` export to use
- **Props table** — all available props with types, defaults, and descriptions
- **Variants** — available visual variants and their prop values
- **Accessibility guidelines** — ARIA attributes, keyboard navigation, screen reader behavior
- **Storybook link** — direct URL to the component's live documentation at `https://ui.unoff.dev/`

**Example of what `get_design_context` returns for a component:**

```
Component: Button
Description: A versatile button component supporting multiple variants...
Props: variant (primary|secondary|ghost), size (sm|md|lg), disabled, loading...
Storybook: https://ui.unoff.dev/?path=/docs/components-button--docs
Accessibility: Uses native <button>, supports aria-label, keyboard focus...
```

This embedded documentation **is the primary reference** for understanding how to use each component. Always read it before consulting external sources.

### Component Mapping Rules

1. **Read the component description** returned by `get_design_context` — it contains props, variants, accessibility guidelines, and Storybook links
2. **Identify the Figma component name** from the output (e.g., `Button`, `FormItem`, `Dropdown`, `SimpleSlider`, `MultipleSlider`, `SingleSelect`, `TextInput`, `ColorInput`, `Knob`, `NumberInput`, `Menu`, `Chip`, `SectionTitle`, `Icon`, etc.)
3. **Match it to the `@unoff/ui` export** — the naming is consistent between Figma and the library
4. **Use the props documented in the description** to configure the component correctly
5. **Consult the Storybook link** from the description for interactive examples and edge cases
6. **Import directly** from `@unoff/ui`:
   ```typescript
   import { Button, FormItem, Dropdown, SimpleSlider, MultipleSlider } from '@unoff/ui'
   ```

### Available Components (non-exhaustive)

- **Layout**: Card, Panel, Section, SectionTitle, Divider, Container, Bar
- **Forms**: Button, FormItem, TextInput, NumberInput, ColorInput, Select, SingleSelect, Checkbox, Radio, Toggle, TextArea, Dropdown
- **Sliders**: SimpleSlider, MultipleSlider, Knob
- **Feedback**: Dialog, Notification, SemanticMessage, Spinner, ProgressBar
- **Navigation**: Tabs, Menu, Dropdown, Bar
- **Display**: Badge, Icon, IconChip, Chip, Tooltip, Tag

### What to Do When a Figma Component Has No `unoff-ui` Match

If a design element does not correspond to any `unoff-ui` component:
1. Build a custom component using project conventions
2. Compose it using `unoff-ui` primitives where possible (e.g., `Button` + `Icon`)
3. Apply `unoff-ui` utility classes (`texts`, `layouts`) for consistent typography and spacing

## Required Workflow

**Follow these steps in order. Do not skip steps.**

### Step 1: Get Node ID

#### Option A: Parse from Figma URL

When the user provides a Figma URL, extract the file key and node ID to pass as arguments to MCP tools.

**URL format:** `https://figma.com/design/:fileKey/:fileName?node-id=1-2`

**Extract:**

- **File key:** `:fileKey` (the segment after `/design/`)
- **Node ID:** `1-2` (the value of the `node-id` query parameter)

**Note:** When using the local desktop MCP (`figma-desktop`), `fileKey` is not passed as a parameter to tool calls. The server automatically uses the currently open file, so only `nodeId` is needed.

**Example:**

- URL: `https://figma.com/design/kL9xQn2VwM8pYrTb4ZcHjF/DesignSystem?node-id=42-15`
- File key: `kL9xQn2VwM8pYrTb4ZcHjF`
- Node ID: `42-15`

#### Option B: Use Current Selection from Figma Desktop App (figma-desktop MCP only)

When using the `figma-desktop` MCP and the user has NOT provided a URL, the tools automatically use the currently selected node from the open Figma file in the desktop app.

**Note:** Selection-based prompting only works with the `figma-desktop` MCP server. The remote server requires a link to a frame or layer to extract context. The user must have the Figma desktop app open with a node selected.

### Step 2: Get the Spec Document Structure

Start by understanding the overall structure of the spec document.

1. Run `get_metadata(fileKey=":fileKey", nodeId="1-2")` to get the hierarchical node map
2. Identify the main sections (e.g., `Bar`, `Scale`, `Details`, `Actions`) and their child node IDs
3. Run `get_screenshot(fileKey=":fileKey", nodeId="1-2")` for a full visual overview

This gives you a mental model of the feature before diving into implementation details.

### Step 3: Fetch Design Context for Each Section

For each section identified in the metadata, run `get_design_context`:

```
get_design_context(fileKey=":fileKey", nodeId=":sectionNodeId")
```

This provides:

- Layout properties (Auto Layout, constraints, sizing)
- Typography specifications
- Color values and design tokens
- **Component instances with embedded documentation** (props, variants, accessibility, Storybook links)
- **Annotations** (`data-development-annotations`, `data-content-annotations`, `data-interaction-annotations`)
- Spacing and padding values

**Process each section's output:**

1. **Read all component descriptions** — they tell you exactly which `@unoff/ui` components to use and how to configure them
2. **Extract all annotations** — collect every `data-*-annotations` attribute and catalog them by category
3. **Note any cross-references** — content annotations may link to other nodes; fetch those too

**If the response is too large or truncated:**

1. Use the metadata from Step 2 to identify smaller subsections
2. Fetch individual child nodes with `get_design_context(fileKey=":fileKey", nodeId=":childNodeId")`

### Step 4: Download Required Assets

Download any assets (images, icons, SVGs) returned by the Figma MCP server.

**IMPORTANT:** Follow these asset rules:

- If the Figma MCP server returns a `localhost` source for an image or SVG, use that source directly
- DO NOT import or add new icon packages — all assets should come from the Figma payload
- DO NOT use or create placeholders if a `localhost` source is provided
- Assets are served through the Figma MCP server's built-in assets endpoint

### Step 5: Translate to Project Conventions

Translate the Figma output into this project's framework, styles, and conventions.

**Key principles:**

- Treat the Figma MCP output (typically React + Tailwind) as a representation of design and behavior, not as final code style
- **Use the component documentation from `get_design_context`** — read the embedded descriptions, props, and Storybook links to correctly configure each `@unoff/ui` component
- **Map Figma component instances to `@unoff/ui` imports** — the Figma library is connected to this package via embedded documentation
- Replace Tailwind utility classes with `unoff-ui` utility classes (`texts`, `layouts`) or the project's design tokens
- Reuse existing `unoff-ui` components instead of duplicating functionality
- Use the project's color system, typography scale, and spacing tokens consistently
- Respect existing routing, state management, and data-fetch patterns
- When unsure about a component's API, **follow the Storybook link from the component description** or visit https://ui.unoff.dev/

### Step 6: Implement Annotation-Driven Behavior

After building the visual UI, implement all behavior specified by annotations:

1. **Development annotations** → implement the technical specs (computed values, conditional logic, data transformations)
2. **Content annotations** → implement hidden content (dropdown options, menu items, expandable sections, dialog content)
3. **Interaction annotations** → implement user interaction behavior (state changes on drag, side effects between components, dynamic UI updates)

**Critical rules:**

- Annotations describe behavior that is **not visible in the screenshot** — they are the only source for this information
- Every annotation MUST be implemented — they are not optional or advisory
- When a content annotation lists options (e.g., "Options: 1. Sync with local variables 2. Sync with local styles"), those are the actual items to render in the dropdown/menu/select
- When an interaction annotation describes a state change (e.g., "If moved, the ratio becomes 'Custom'"), implement that exact reactive behavior

### Step 7: Achieve 1:1 Visual Parity

Strive for pixel-perfect visual parity with the Figma design.

**Guidelines:**

- Prioritize Figma fidelity to match designs exactly
- Avoid hardcoded values — use design tokens from Figma where available
- When conflicts arise between design system tokens and Figma specs, prefer design system tokens but adjust spacing or sizes minimally to match visuals
- Follow WCAG requirements for accessibility
- Add component documentation as needed

### Step 8: Validate Against Figma

Before marking complete, validate the final UI against the Figma screenshot.

**Validation checklist:**

- [ ] Layout matches (spacing, alignment, sizing)
- [ ] Typography matches (font, size, weight, line height)
- [ ] Colors match exactly
- [ ] All `@unoff/ui` components are correctly imported (not recreated)
- [ ] Component props match the documentation from `get_design_context`
- [ ] All development annotations are implemented
- [ ] All content annotations are implemented (hidden options, dropdown items, etc.)
- [ ] All interaction annotations are implemented (state changes, reactive behavior)
- [ ] Interactive states work as designed (hover, active, disabled)
- [ ] Responsive behavior follows Figma constraints
- [ ] Assets render correctly
- [ ] Accessibility standards met

## Implementation Rules

### Component Organization

- Place UI components in the project's designated design system directory
- Follow the project's component naming conventions
- Avoid inline styles unless truly necessary for dynamic values

### Design System Integration

- **ALWAYS check `@unoff/ui` first** — Figma library components are documented directly in `get_design_context` output
- **Read the embedded component documentation** (props, variants, accessibility) before consulting external sources
- Follow the Storybook links from component descriptions for interactive examples
- Map Figma design tokens to project design tokens
- When a matching component exists in `unoff-ui`, use it directly rather than creating a new one
- Document any new custom components that don't exist in `unoff-ui`

### Annotation Processing

- **Annotations are implementation requirements**, not comments or suggestions
- Parse all three categories: `data-development-annotations`, `data-content-annotations`, `data-interaction-annotations`
- Content annotations may contain **cross-references** to other Figma nodes — always follow these links
- Never render annotation text in the UI
- When annotations conflict with the visual design, annotations take precedence for behavior (visual design takes precedence for appearance)

### Code Quality

- Avoid hardcoded values — extract to constants or design tokens
- Keep components composable and reusable
- Add TypeScript types for component props
- Include JSDoc comments for exported components

## Examples

### Example 1: Implementing a Feature from a Spec Document

User says: "Implement this feature: https://figma.com/design/RDBmy7x5HfkZHpafVqHNWQ/MyPlugin?node-id=3353-235509"

**Actions:**

1. Parse URL to extract fileKey=`RDBmy7x5HfkZHpafVqHNWQ` and nodeId=`3353-235509`
2. Convert `-` to `:` in nodeId → `3353:235509`
3. Run `get_metadata(fileKey="RDBmy7x5HfkZHpafVqHNWQ", nodeId="3353:235509")` to understand the page structure
4. Run `get_screenshot(fileKey="RDBmy7x5HfkZHpafVqHNWQ", nodeId="3353:235509")` for visual reference
5. Identify main sections from metadata (e.g., Bar, Scale settings, Details panel, Actions bar)
6. For each section, run `get_design_context` to fetch components and annotations
7. Read component descriptions — use the documented props and Storybook links to configure `@unoff/ui` imports
8. Extract all annotations:
   - Development: technical specs for computed values, conditional logic
   - Content: hidden dropdown options, expandable section content
   - Interaction: reactive behavior between components
9. Build the feature:
   - Import `@unoff/ui` components (`Button`, `FormItem`, `Dropdown`, `SimpleSlider`, `MultipleSlider`, etc.)
   - Implement visual layout matching the screenshot
   - Implement annotation-driven behavior (hidden options, computed values, state relationships)
10. Validate against screenshot and annotation checklist

**Result:** Complete feature matching the Figma spec — visual design from the screenshot, behavior from the annotations, components from `@unoff/ui`.

### Example 2: Handling a Spec with Cross-References

User says: "Build this panel: https://figma.com/design/pR8mNv5KqXzGwY2JtCfL4D/Dashboard?node-id=10-5"

**Actions:**

1. Parse URL and fetch metadata + screenshot
2. Fetch design context for the panel
3. Find a content annotation with a cross-reference: `data-content-annotations="Idem: https://www.figma.com/design/pR8mNv5KqXzGwY2JtCfL4D/Dashboard?node-id=20-8"`
4. Parse the referenced URL and fetch its design context too
5. Apply the referenced spec — "Idem" means the behavior is identical to the referenced node
6. Implement both the visual design and the cross-referenced behavior
7. Validate against both the current node and the referenced node

**Result:** Panel correctly implements behavior defined in a different part of the spec document.

## Best Practices

### Always Start with Metadata

For spec documents, start with `get_metadata` to understand the full structure before fetching individual sections. This prevents missing annotations or components buried in child nodes.

### Read Component Documentation First

The `get_design_context` output contains rich component documentation. Read it thoroughly — it tells you exactly which props to use, which variants are available, and how to handle accessibility. This is more reliable than guessing from the visual design alone.

### Process All Annotations

Annotations are easy to miss in large outputs. Systematically search for `data-development-annotations`, `data-content-annotations`, and `data-interaction-annotations` in every `get_design_context` response.

### Follow Cross-References

Content annotations may contain Figma links to related specs. Always fetch and process these — they often contain critical implementation details not present in the current node.

### Incremental Validation

Validate frequently during implementation, not just at the end. This catches issues early.

### Document Deviations

If you must deviate from the Figma design (e.g., for accessibility or technical constraints), document why in code comments.

### Reuse Over Recreation

Always check `@unoff/ui` and the component descriptions from `get_design_context` before creating new components. The Figma library components are documented directly in the MCP output — if a component exists in the design, it almost certainly exists in the library. Consistency across the codebase is more important than exact Figma replication.

### Design System First

When in doubt, prefer `unoff-ui` components and the project's design system patterns over literal Figma translation.

## Common Issues and Solutions

### Issue: Figma output is truncated

**Cause:** The design is too complex or has too many nested layers to return in a single response.
**Solution:** Use `get_metadata` to get the node structure, then fetch specific sections individually with `get_design_context`.

### Issue: Design doesn't match after implementation

**Cause:** Visual discrepancies between the implemented code and the original Figma design.
**Solution:** Compare side-by-side with the screenshot from Step 2. Check spacing, colors, and typography values in the design context data.

### Issue: Missing hidden UI (dropdowns, menus, dialogs)

**Cause:** Content annotations describe UI elements not visible in the static screenshot.
**Solution:** Search the `get_design_context` output for `data-content-annotations`. These annotations list dropdown options, menu items, dialog content, and expandable section content that must be implemented even though they're not shown in the screenshot.

### Issue: Component props are wrong

**Cause:** The component was configured based on visual appearance rather than the embedded documentation.
**Solution:** Re-read the component description from `get_design_context`. It contains the exact props, variants, and types. Follow the Storybook link for interactive examples.

### Issue: Reactive behavior is missing

**Cause:** Interaction annotations were not processed.
**Solution:** Search for `data-interaction-annotations` in the design context output. These describe state changes, side effects between components, and dynamic UI updates that must be implemented.

### Issue: Assets not loading

**Cause:** The Figma MCP server's assets endpoint is not accessible or the URLs are being modified.
**Solution:** Verify the Figma MCP server's assets endpoint is accessible. The server serves assets at `localhost` URLs. Use these directly without modification.

### Issue: Design token values differ from Figma

**Cause:** The project's design system tokens have different values than those specified in the Figma design.
**Solution:** When project tokens differ from Figma values, prefer project tokens for consistency but adjust spacing/sizing to maintain visual fidelity.

### Issue: Cross-referenced spec is in a different file

**Cause:** A content annotation contains a Figma link to a node in a different file.
**Solution:** Parse the `fileKey` from the cross-reference URL and use it in `get_design_context` calls. The referenced file may require separate metadata fetching.

## Understanding Design Implementation

The Figma spec document workflow establishes a reliable process for translating designs to code:

**For designers:** Spec documents are the single source of truth — annotations ensure that behavior, content, and interaction details are conveyed precisely without ambiguity.
**For developers:** A structured approach that eliminates guesswork — component documentation and annotations provide all the implementation details needed without back-and-forth.
**For teams:** Consistent, high-quality implementations that maintain design system integrity through `@unoff/ui` reuse and annotation-driven behavior.

By following this workflow, you ensure that every Figma spec document is implemented with the same level of care and attention to detail — from visual fidelity to behavioral accuracy.
